# HSCC
HSCC is a Switch-based Congestion Control Framework for Data Centre Networks. 
Specifically, it aims at expanding the short TCP loss cycles via hysteresis switching and the switch control law switches between two rate modes at the end-host (i.e., TCP mode and slow CBR mode) 

It is implemented as a hardware prototype in NetFPGA platform using verilog hardware language.
